Dependencies: RDKit, [DeepSMILES](https://github.com/nextmovesoftware/deepsmiles) and [SELFIES](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies).

Example

```
python GA_logP_smiles.py xxx.smi
```

where xxx.smi is list of SMILES strings from which the initial population will be drawn, e.g. ZINC_first_1000.smi.
